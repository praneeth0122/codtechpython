# Expense Tracker App Documentation

## Project Title: Expense Tracker App

## Submitted To: CODTECH

---

## üìå Objective

To develop a mobile application that enables users to:
- Track daily expenses.
- Categorize those expenses (e.g., Food, Transport, Bills).
- Display summaries of spending using interactive charts.
- Persist data locally using Room or SQLite database.

---

## üì± Application Features

### ‚úÖ Add Expense
- User inputs: amount, category, description, date.
- Automatically saved to the local database.

### ‚úÖ Categorize Expenses
- Supports common categories: Food, Transport, Shopping, Bills, Others.
- Option to add new custom categories (optional feature).

### ‚úÖ View All Expenses
- Expenses displayed in a list sorted by date.
- Each item shows details like amount, category, and date.

### ‚úÖ Charts & Summary
- Use of MPAndroidChart to display spending breakdown.
- Pie chart shows how much was spent on each category.

### ‚úÖ Data Persistence
- Uses Room (preferred) or SQLite to store data.
- Ensures data is retained even if the app is closed or restarted.

---

## üìÇ Project Architecture

Uses **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture for better separation of concerns.

- **Model** ‚Äì Data layer (Room database + Entity + DAO)
- **ViewModel** ‚Äì Acts as a bridge between UI and database
- **View** ‚Äì UI components (Activities & Fragments)

## üì¶ Code Modules Overview

### 1. Expense.kt
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "expenses")
data class Expense(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
    val amount: Double,
    val category: String,
    val description: String,
    val date: Long
)
```

### 2. ExpenseDao.kt
```kotlin
@Dao
interface ExpenseDao {
    @Insert
    suspend fun insertExpense(expense: Expense)

    @Query("SELECT * FROM expenses ORDER BY date DESC")
    fun getAllExpenses(): LiveData<List<Expense>>

    @Query("SELECT category, SUM(amount) as total FROM expenses GROUP BY category")
    fun getCategoryTotals(): LiveData<List<CategoryTotal>>
}
```

### 3. CategoryTotal.kt
```kotlin
data class CategoryTotal(
    val category: String,
    val total: Double
)
```

### 4. ExpenseDatabase.kt
```kotlin
@Database(entities = [Expense::class], version = 1)
abstract class ExpenseDatabase : RoomDatabase() {
    abstract fun expenseDao(): ExpenseDao

    companion object {
        @Volatile private var INSTANCE: ExpenseDatabase? = null

        fun getDatabase(context: Context): ExpenseDatabase {
            return INSTANCE ?: synchronized(this) {
                val instance = Room.databaseBuilder(
                    context.applicationContext,
                    ExpenseDatabase::class.java,
                    "expense_database"
                ).build()
                INSTANCE = instance
                instance
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. ExpenseRepository.kt
```kotlin
class ExpenseRepository(private val dao: ExpenseDao) {
    fun getAllExpenses() = dao.getAllExpenses()
    fun getCategoryTotals() = dao.getCategoryTotals()
    suspend fun insertExpense(expense: Expense) = dao.insertExpense(expense)
}
```

### 6. ExpenseViewModel.kt
```kotlin
class ExpenseViewModel(application: Application) : AndroidViewModel(application) {
    private val repository: ExpenseRepository

    val allExpenses: LiveData<List<Expense>>
    val categoryTotals: LiveData<List<CategoryTotal>>

    init {
        val dao = ExpenseDatabase.getDatabase(application).expenseDao()
        repository = ExpenseRepository(dao)
        allExpenses = repository.getAllExpenses()
        categoryTotals = repository.getCategoryTotals()
    }

    fun insert(expense: Expense) = viewModelScope.launch {
        repository.insertExpense(expense)
    }
}
```

### 7. ChartFragment.kt
```kotlin
class ChartFragment : Fragment() {

    private lateinit var viewModel: ExpenseViewModel

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        val view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_chart, container, false)
        val pieChart = view.findViewById<PieChart>(R.id.pieChart)

        viewModel = ViewModelProvider(this)[ExpenseViewModel::class.java]
        viewModel.categoryTotals.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) { totals ->
            val entries = totals.map { PieEntry(it.total.toFloat(), it.category) }
            val dataSet = PieDataSet(entries, "Expenses")
            val data = PieData(dataSet)
            pieChart.data = data
            pieChart.invalidate()
        }

        return view
    }
}
```

## üñºÔ∏è UI Layout Suggestions

1. **Activity Layout (activity_main.xml)**
- FrameLayout or NavHostFragment

2. **Add Expense Fragment (fragment_add_expense.xml)**
- TextInputs: Amount, Description
- Spinner: Category
- DatePicker
- Save Button

3. **List Fragment (fragment_expense_list.xml)**
- RecyclerView to list expenses

4. **Chart Fragment (fragment_chart.xml)**
- MPAndroidChart PieChart View

---

## üìà Output
- User can enter expenses with details.
- View all past expenses.
- See visual breakdown of expenses.
- Data remains available after app restarts.

---

## üìã Deliverables

- **APK file or Android Studio Project**
- **Working application with UI and charts**
- **Source code with Room or SQLite integration**

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Cloud backup with Firebase.
- Export data as CSV or PDF.
- Dark mode support.
- Set monthly budget limits.
- Notifications for overspending.

---

## üôå Conclusion

This Expense Tracker App meets the requirements by:
- Capturing and organizing expenses
- Persisting data locally
- Providing clear visual insights

It serves as a foundational budgeting app and can be extended with more features easily.
